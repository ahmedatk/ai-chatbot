- **Context Management**: Maintains conversational context for multi-turn interactions.
- **Customizable Responses**: Easily tailor response logic and personality.
- **Integration Ready**: Adaptable for use in websites, apps, or messaging platforms.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add skills, intents, and external APIs.
- **Open Source**: MIT license for maximum flexibility.
